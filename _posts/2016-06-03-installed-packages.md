This blog is written using [Atom](https://atom.io) and a few essential
add on packages.  Here are the packages used:

[browser-refresh-on-save](https://atom.io/packages/browser-refresh-on-save){:target="blank"}

>Reloads assets in the browser as soon as you save them

I use this to view the changes made in the browser without having
to manually switch back and refresh for every change.

[git-plus](https://atom.io/packages/git-plus){:target="blank"}

>Do git things without the terminal

I use this to commit and push files from within atom

[linter](https://atom.io/packages/linter){:target="blank"}

>A base linter with cow powers

This is a base linter package used for visualizing syntax and
similar errors on the fly

[linter-markdown](https://atom.io/packages/linter-markdown){:target="blank"}

>Lint Markdown on the fly, using remark-lint

This provides Markdown capabilities to the linter packages. It does need to be [customized](/customizations-for-linter-markdown) to work correctly for Jekyll sites, though.

[markdown-writer](https://atom.io/packages/markdown-writer){:target="blank"}

>Make Atom a better Markdown editor and an easier static blogging tool

This has quite a few features useful for editing Markdown and/or creating Jekyll sites.  Right now I'm mostly just using the feature that automatically fills out the Frontmatter portion of new files

[minimap](https://atom.io/packages/minimap){:target="blank"}

>A preview of the full source code

This provides a small thumbnail view of the entire file in the
corner of the view
